# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that operate in the physical world, not just in software. 
These systems understand physics, interact with real environments, and perform human-like tasks.

## Why Physical AI Matters
Modern AI models are powerful in digital environments, but the future belongs to embodied intelligence — AI with a body.

Humanoid robots are effective because:
- They match human environments (stairs, doors, tools)
- They can learn from vast real-world data
- They can perform physical labor and assist humans

## Course Goals
In this textbook, you will learn:
- ROS 2 (The robotic nervous system)
- Gazebo & Unity (Digital twins & simulation)
- NVIDIA Isaac (AI robot brain)
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems
- Building a humanoid robot that listens, plans, walks, sees, and manipulates objects.
